# Harpy
Harpy is a music-based light installation that aims to provide users with an outlet for expression to add vibrancy to their mundane lives. It has 28 strings, that each corresponds to a note when pulled and released.

Created as the final project for SUTD's 3.007 Design Thinking and Innovation module.

## Features
### 1. Free play
This mode lets users play any note they want. When a string is pulled and then released, the string lights up, and the note plays. Chords can be played by releasing a few strings at the same time.
### 2. Challenge 
Users choose a song that they would like to play. The note(s) that has/have to be played will be lit up. The correct notes will only play if they pluck the correct strings, and the next note(s) in the song will be lit up.
### 3. Album
Users pick a song, which Harpy will then play. When the notes are played, the corresponding strings will light up.
